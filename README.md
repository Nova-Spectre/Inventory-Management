Description:
This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive Inventory Management API built using Java Spring Boot. The application utilizes MongoDB and MySQL for database management, Kafka and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging, Spring API Gateway for routing and filtering, and integrates Spring Security for robust authentication. Eureka is employed for service discovery, Zipkin for distributed tracing, and Elasticsearch with Kibana for efficient full-text search and log analysis.

Key Features:

Microservices Architecture: The project follows a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
MongoDB and MySQL Integration: Utilizes both MongoDB and MySQL databases for storing and managing diverse data types.
Message Queues (Kafka and RabbitMQ): Implements Kafka and RabbitMQ for efficient and reliable asynchronous communication between services.
API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway): Facilitates routing, filtering, and load balancing to streamline API requests.
Authentication (Spring Security with JWT): Ensures secure access to API endpoints through robust authentication mechanisms.
Service Discovery (Eureka): Enables automatic service registration and discovery for improved scalability.
Distributed Tracing (Zipkin): Monitors and troubleshoots requests across microservices to enhance performance.
Elasticsearch with Kibana: Provides powerful full-text search capabilities and visualizes log data for effective analysis.
